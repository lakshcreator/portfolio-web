        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! I'm Laxmi Narayana Maharana, a passionate student pursuing a Bachelor of Computer Applications  and currently interning in Web Development. My journey in the world of technology started with a curiosity to understand how websites and applications are built, and this interest quickly turned into a commitment to mastering web development.

Through my internship, I’ve gained hands-on experience in creating dynamic and responsive websites, developing a deeper understanding of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other web technologies. I’m always eager to learn more, experiment with new tools, and refine my skills to keep up with the ever-evolving field of web development.

When I’m not coding, I enjoy exploring new tech trends, collaborating with others to bring ideas to life, and learning more about how technology can make a difference in our daily lives. I’m excited about the future and the opportunities to grow as a web developer, and I’m always open to new challenges and learning experiences.

Feel free to browse through my portfolio to see some of the projects I’ve worked on, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you’d like to connect or discuss potential opportunities.</p>
