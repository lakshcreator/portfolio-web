# Portfolio-web
This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website.  
The website includes:  
- A *Home* page introducing the user.  
- An *About* page describing skills and experiences.  
- A *Portfolio* page showcasing completed projects.  
- A *Contact* page with ways to get in touch.  

The website is designed to highlight my skills and projects effectively for academic and professional purposes.
